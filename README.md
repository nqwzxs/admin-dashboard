# Admin Dashboard

Admin Dashboard is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) consisting of a web page with sidebar, header and main content.

In this project, I had to use a lot of CSS Grid, so I didn't use Flexbox at all. Web page consists of a sidebar which has some links, header with searchbar, user info and buttons, and main content which consists of 3 other sections like projects, announcements and trending, and all of them are aligned by CSS Grid using grid-template-columns, gap, justify-content, align-items, etc.
